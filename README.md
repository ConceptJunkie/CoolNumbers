# CoolNumbers

This is just a list of cool numbers that I've discovered with rpn.  I was thinking one day that I wanted to make sure I backed this stuff up in a safe place, and I finally realized it should go on GitHub.

## powers_of_10_next_primes.txt

This is an ongoing project to find the first prime after successive powers of 10.

## 50th_mersenne_prime.txt

The 50th Mersenne Prime was discovered recently.  It took rpn about an hour to calculate the whole thing out.

## 10_x_primes.txt

This is a list of primes of the form m * 10^n + k, where m and k are one digit numbers, and n ranges from 1 to 2000.

##  pi_10million.txt

Ten million digits of pi converted to base 26, using the letters a-z to represent the digits.  This results in about 7 million hexavigesimal digits.  Find your name in pi!

## 100_repunit_minus_2.txt, 100_repunit_minus_1.txt, 100_repunit_plus_1.txt, 100_repunit_plus_2.txt

These are primes based on base-100 repunits (i.e. 010101..0101 * n +/ 1 or 2, where n ranges from 1 to 750)

In simpler terms, these are 4 lists of prime numbers constructed from repeating strings of 2 digits up to 750 times, and then subtracting 2 and 1, and adding 1 and 2, respectivelty from the resulting number.
